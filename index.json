I worked with the Linux Foundation, under Automotive Grade Linux to develop a Qt5 Application to Visualise/ Simulate CAN bus traffic using Kuksa.val\nYou can find the proposal for this project here.\nThe Linux Foundation is a nonprofit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux. Automotive Grade Linux is an open-source project hosted by The Linux Foundation that is building an open operating system and framework for automotive applications.\nProject Overview # The objective of this project was to develop a Qt5 application that simulates CAN bus traffic using Kuksa.val to integrate with the AGL Demo platform. The application developed allows the end-users to emit signals using the kuksa-client SDK and Python-can to visualize and interact with AGL Demo applications, such as the IC, IVI, HVAC, and the Green Machine, that display CAN data through Kuksa.val.\n# Source Code \u0026amp; Documentation # → Gerrit: agl-demo-control-panel\n→ GitHub: AGL_Demo_Control_Panel\n→ Documentation: AGL/documentation\n# Deliverables # Building a modern Qt5 application using PyQt5/QML that can simulate CAN-Bus signals using kuksa.val. Integrate the application with the AGL Demo platform. Packaging and distribution of the Application. Update documentation pages based on work. Work Done # # Progress Reports # → Community Bonding Period: During the GSoC 2023 community bonding period, I had a fantastic learning experience. I got to know my GSoC mentors and the AGL community, familiarized myself with AGL tools, and set up my working environment. I also tackled some technical challenges and ventured into working with Kuksa-val-server, Kuksa-client, and AGL images. Overall, the community bonding period was a great start.\n→ Coding Period: The coding period of GSoC is a dedicated timeframe during which the accepted contributors work on their projects. The standard coding period is 12 weeks. However, my mentors and I saw it fit to have a longer coding period of 22 weeks to complete our Large-Scale project.\nDuring this period, I was able to:\nWrite and submit my code to Gerrit/GitHub. Issue patches and bug fixes based on review. Regularly communicate with my mentors. (Mondays) Participate in the AGL and GSoC community. (Thursdays) Submit my work for mid-term and final evaluations. Below I have compiled all my Weekly Progress Reports for the duration of the coding period of GSoC \u0026lsquo;23.\nWeek 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5 Week 6 Week 7 Week 8 Week 9 Week 10 Week 11 Week 12 Week 13 Week 14 Week 15 Week 16 Week 17 Week 18 Week 19 Week 20 Week 21 Week 22 # Major Gerrit Commits # 29339: agl-demo-control-panel: Improve gRPC Mode 29311: agl-demo-control-panel: Add Fullscreen / maximized option 29302: agl-demo-control-panel: Save user preferences for next session 29291: agl-demo-control-panel: Fix Svg icons scaling on Dashboard 29279: agl-demo-control-panel: Refactor Settings, Config and UI scaling 29275: agl-demo-control-panel: Add installation steps for debian/RPiOS 29270: agl-demo-control-panel: Add grpc support for databroker 29060: Upload progress on AGL demo control panel in one batch Conclusion # # What did I learn? # I was able to learn about the OpenEmbedded Yocto Project and create layers and recipes for our specific application. I learnt how to create quality applications using Qt, PyQt. Learnt about gRPC and WebSocket and how they are implemented in Kuksa.val and its Python SDK. I had the opportunity to test my application and AGL images on a Raspberry Pi 4 kindly provided by my AGL mentors. I was also provided a pair of CAN to USB adapters for testing CAN signals. While we ended up not using it for our demo it did help me learn more about CAN interfaces, Linux kernel modules, and Python-can. I was also able to test my application using the agl-ivi-demo-control-panel image on ARM, X86 using QEMU/KVM. Additionally, we also got a docker image to work for the agl-demo-control-panel thanks to Lisandro Pérez Meyer. I also learned a lot more about the Automotive Grade Linux organization, its development tools, workflow, and pipeline. # Post GSoC # I plan to maintain and add to the Automotive Grade Linux’s repository for my project for the foreseeable future and work on continually improving it. I will keep contributing and help other new contributors to explore and learn projects in this organization. Acknowledgments # I would like to express my gratitude to my mentors Jan-Simon Möller, Scott Murray, Marius Vlad, and Walt Miner for mentoring me through GSoC and also to the whole AGL community for being so inclusive and friendly.\nIt has been one of the best professional experiences that I have had this year. Learning about new tools and technologies, and working on an open-source project along with experienced developers from all over the world has been a great experience for me. I would love to continue working with AGL, improving my project, and whatever I feel that I can contribute to.\n","date":"31 October 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/final-report/","section":"Blog Posts","summary":"Introduction # This report is a requirement of the Final evaluation phase of the Google Summer of Code the Google program.","title":"GSoC 2023 Final Report"},{"content":"","date":"31 October 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/gsoc-final-report/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"GSoC Final Report"},{"content":"","date":"31 October 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":"31 October 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/the-linux-foundation/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"The Linux Foundation"},{"content":"","date":"28 October 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/gsoc-23-wpr/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"GSoC '23 WPR"},{"content":" # Topics To Be Covered In This Post # What I did this week Pushing code and bug fixes to Gerrit.

Disable the curved window corners. This avoids needing to worry about the background color showing up in the corners and potentially needing to get a custom Weston configuration file in place to avoid the default background. User Preference # This week I also added the ability to save user preferences for the next session, thereby making the preferred configuration persist across sessions.

The bug was reported in SPEC-4939. I also patched the scaling issue of the SVG icons for the dashboard of the control panel using the QtSvg module of PyQt5, however on Debian-based systems, this sub-module is only available through the python3-PyQt5.QtSvg package. Fixed a bug where new-config would not be created due to a key error when stating the client in the AGL-kuksa-val-server config. UI Tweaks # Increased DejaVu font sizes for QLabels and QPushButtons to make the text more legible. Removed QScrollbar components to better adjust to smaller screens and remove clipped borders in QStacked widget frames. Start/Stop button was redone to help manage sessions of the client more easily. The client is now stops when AGL_Demo_Control_Panel is closed using the window controls. Refactored Kuksa Subscription # This week I also refactored the way subscribed updates are handled in the control panel, previously the application would both subscribe to any changes made to a signal and also set the updated values, and since the new values set on the control panel trigger a send_values function when an event occurs, the values would be set twice.\nThis week I refactored by making use of pyqtsignals and slotted functions which not only help in sending interpreters communication between modules but also threads. Now whenever the values are being set by the control panel, all updates made via the subscription module are blocked temporarily. This helps remove the jittery feeling in the sliders when setting new values.\nDocumentation and README # This week I also updated the documentation and README to include updated screen-shots, installation, and setup processes. This included,\nUpdate installation steps. Steps to including/defining custom config files (.ini) and where to place them. Fix typos in the assets directory name. # What Next? # Issue bug fixes as required. Continue pushing code and documentation to Gerrit. Prepare for the final submission of the GSoC project evaluation.

The animation starts when the start method of the QPropertyAnimation object is called.\nThe QEasingCurve.OutCubic easing curve is used to make the transition smoother. When the animation is finished, we close the old widget and show the new one.\nAdditionally, I also added an animation to move in and out of the Dashboard such that the Navigation bar collapses when in the Dashboard as the user can use the navigation tiles instead.\n# What Next? # Upload to Gerrit and issue patches based on review.

What I plan to do next # How to use cannelloni # To test the AGL Demo Control Panel for sending CAN messages to the target machine, we can create a virtual CAN interface using cannelloni. Cannelloni is a SocketCAN over Ethernet tunnel that uses UDP to transfer CAN frames between two machines. Here are the steps used to create a vcan interface using Cannelloni between the host machine (laptop) and target machine (Raspberry Pi) running the AGL IVI Image:\nNote: Since I am using the IVI image for testing this, there is no need to install cannelloni and configure the can0 interface on the target machine.\nOn both machines, create the virtual CAN interface with the command: sudo ip link add dev can0 type vcan On both machines, bring the virtual CAN interface online with the command: sudo ip link set up can0 On both machines, install cannelloni from its GitHub repository On one machine (e.g. the laptop), run cannelloni as a server with the command: cannelloni -I can0 -R \u0026lt;raspberry pi IP address\u0026gt; -L \\ \u0026lt;laptop IP address\u0026gt; -S 20000 -D 20000 On the other machine (e.g. the Raspberry Pi), run cannelloni as a client with the command: cannelloni -I can0 -R \u0026lt;laptop IP address\u0026gt; -L \\ \u0026lt;raspberry pi IP address\u0026gt; -S 20000 -D 20000 You should now be able to send and receive CAN frames between the two machines using the vcan interface and Cannelloni.

Features of this module are as follows:\nConfigure Kuksa-client Custom IP address JWT token path Toggle for Insecure mode Start/ Reconnect Kuksa-client Display Connection Status How Does it Work? # We first created a KuksaSingleton module using the Singleton Design Pattern. The benefits of using the Singleton design pattern are:\nInitialization: An object created by the Singleton method is initialized only when it is requested for the first time. Access to the object: We get global access to the instance of the object. Count of instances: In singleton, method classes can’t have more than one instance This allows us to maintain a single instance of the kuksa-client object, and have access to it globally.\nimport kuksa_client as kuksa class KuksaClientSingleton: __instance = None @staticmethod def get_instance(): if KuksaClientSingleton.__instance is None: KuksaClientSingleton() return KuksaClientSingleton.__instance def __init__(self): if KuksaClientSingleton.__instance is not None: raise Exception(\u0026#34;This class is a singleton!\u0026#34;) else: self.default_Config = { \u0026#34;ip\u0026#34;: \u0026#39;10.10.10.203\u0026#39;, \u0026#34;port\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;8090\u0026#34;, \u0026#39;protocol\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;ws\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;insecure\u0026#39;: True, } self.token = \u0026#34;/home/suchinton/.local/lib/\\ python3.10/site-\\ packages/kuksa_certificates/jwt/\\ super-admin.json.token\u0026#34; try: self.client = kuksa.KuksaClientThread\\ (self.default_Config) self.client.authorize(self.token) self.client.start() except Exception as e: print(e) KuksaClientSingleton.__instance = self def get_client(self): return self.client, self.default_Config, self.token def reconnect_client(self, new_Config, new_Token): self.client.stop() print(self.client.checkConnection()) self.client = kuksa.KuksaClientThread(new_Config) self.client.authorize(new_Token) self.client.start() def __del__(self): self.client.stop() This implementation allows us to write custom functions such as reconnect_client which helps restart the client with new configurations.\nNote: This module will be modified to read and write to a config file which will store the default values and the previous entries.\nAccessing the Kuksa-Client Object # As visible in the above code segment, the client object, its default_Config and the default token path can be retrieved using the get_client method in other modules of this application.\nAll we need to do to get access to the client instance is add the necessary module as such:\n. . . import sys current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) # ======================================== sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(current_dir)) import extras.Kuksa_Instance as kuksa_instance . . . and to create the client object, the following syntax is used:\nself.kuksa = kuksa_instance.KuksaClientSingleton.get_instance() self.client, self.config, self.token = self.kuksa.get_client() Settings Window # The impedimented settings menu was made keeping certain requirements in mind, such as:\nThe client\u0026rsquo;s first instance must be started only via the settings The user should be able to restart the client The settings menu must allow the user to modify the default config It must reflect the status of the connection with Kuksa Note: The StyleSheet is yet to be updated for the Settings Window\n# Kuksa Signals for IC Application # I also added initial support for the IC application by specifying its VSS paths subscribed by it, this allows us to control the visible widget values and states using dials, buttons and input fields.\nThe implementation in the Demo application had some flaws that I was able to overcome this week by optimizing the slider for a smoother experience. This was done using the following Qt modules:\nQTimer object to update the values at a fixed interval instead of updating it every time the slider value changes. This reduces the number of requests sent to the server and makes the application more responsive. QThread object to run the timer in a separate thread so that it doesn’t block the main thread and cause the application to freeze. As a consequence, the app is more responsive, and also the values fed to kuksa-val-server using this method are continuously updated at defined intervals. Which can help us implement dedicated scripts for the AGL demo apps in the future.\nThe signal paths specified for the application comply with the recently released VSS 3.1.1. being used by KUKSA.val 0.3.1.\nNote: During this week\u0026rsquo;s GSoC meeting, my mentors mentioned that since AGL does not, for the time being, use any navigation APIs, We have decided to make the Navigation Widget (mentioned in last week\u0026rsquo;s report) an optional module.\n# GitHub Repository # This week I also initialized the GitHub repository for this project, hosting it under the Apache V2 License after a discussion regarding the same with my mentors.\nThe repository can be accessed using the provided link.\n→ https://github.com/suchinton/AGL_Demo_Control_Panel\n# What Next? # Next week I expect to have complete support for IC Add initial support for HVAC Finalize the UI/UX with mentors Build AGL master branch on remote server # References: # https://www.w3.org/auto/wg/wiki/Vehicle_Signal_Specification_(VSS)/Vehicle_Data_Spec https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/singleton-method-python-design-patterns/ https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/blob/d9dc9f808268be91abd13f8751337cece470c96c/kuksa-client/docs/examples/threaded.md https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/releases https://dias-kuksa-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents/invehicle.html https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 ","date":"9 June 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/week-2/","section":"Blog Posts","summary":"# Topics To Be Covered In This Post # What I did this week Implement Settings Window Initial support for Kuksa Signals Initializing the GitHub Repository What I plan to do next # Settings Window # This week I implemented the settings window to start/ configure an instance of kuksa-client to be used across the whole application.","title":"Week 2 Progress Report"},{"content":" # Topics To Be Covered In This Post # What I did this week Communication with Kuksa.val Skeleton code for GUI using PyQt5 Navigation widget for IC What I plan to do next # Communication With Kuksa.val # Continuing with the progress made last week regarding communication with Kuksa-val-server using a bridged network, I tried to enable IP routing to make the traffic at 10.10.10.204 also accessible at localhost 127.0.0.1, but that did not work.\nTherefore, we run the kuksa-val-server on IP address 0.0.0.0, which is a special IP address known as the “default route” or “unspecified address”. It is used to indicate that traffic should be sent to all interfaces on a machine, regardless of their individual IP addresses.\nThis allows us to sidestep the hassle of setting a dedicated IP address to communicate with Kuksa. Based on these developments, I then modified the Kuksa-client config in my demo application, AGL-Kuksa.val-Visualiser for testing its functionality, The changes made in main.py were:\n. . . config = { \u0026#34;ip\u0026#34;: \u0026#39;10.10.10.203\u0026#39;, \u0026#34;port\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;8090\u0026#34;, \u0026#39;protocol\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;ws\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;insecure\u0026#39;: True, } . . .

Upon successfully connecting to the server,\nhere is a look at how the AGL-Kuksa.val-Visualiser application interacts with the IC demo application.\n# Navigation Input For IC Demo App # This is a work-in-progress widget to be added to the Instrument cluster tab of our GUI application, and seeks to provide the functionality to,\nset current location (from) set destination location (to) provide suggestions for address start navigation It makes use of Folium, which is a Python wrapper for leaflet.js which is a javascript library for plotting interactive maps. It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing rich vector/raster/HTML visualizations as markers on the map.\nThe program has several methods such as search_address fetch_address_suggestions show_suggestions show_location update_map and more. These methods are used for fetching suggestions from OpenStreetMap, displaying suggestions, displaying the location on the map, updating the map, and creating HTML code for the map.\nThe implementation of this feature can be improved in the coming weeks for setting the marker/ address more accurately.\n# Application Preview # Finally, I got to start working on the skeletal code of the main application using Qt5. This is still a fairly bare-bones preview of how the interface would look and is highly subject to change in future revisions.\nAll new widgets created for the AGL demo apps will be added as separate modules to increase the customization and maintainability of the whole application.\n# What Next? # Here are some of my targets for next week,\nImprove implementation of Kuksa-client add support for signals subscribed by the IC Application improve the navigation widget finalize the design for the main application with my mentors # References: # https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/blob/master/kuksa-client/docs/examples/threaded.md https://www.howtogeek.com https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/ https://www.openstreetmap.org/help ","date":"3 June 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/week-1/","section":"Blog Posts","summary":"# Topics To Be Covered In This Post # What I did this week Communication with Kuksa.","title":"Week 1 Progress Report"},{"content":"","date":"26 May 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/community-bonding-period/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Community Bonding Period"},{"content":" # Topics To Be Covered In This Post # What is the Community bonding period? What I did the past month Challenges faced Community interactions What I plan to do next What is GSoC \u0026amp; What Have I Been Up To During The CBP? # Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program that offers students an opportunity to contribute to open-source projects. The program is sponsored by Google and has been running since 2005. The program aims to bring together students and open-source organizations to work on real-world projects. The program has three phases: the community bonding period, the coding period, and the final evaluation period.\nThe community bonding period is the three weeks between GSoC student acceptance and the start of the coding date (May 4th - May 28th). During this period I engaged with my GSoC mentors, Jan-Simon Möller , Walt Miner, Scott Murray, Marius Vlad, and the rest of the AGL community. I used this period to get familiar with the various tools used in AGL and set up my work environment for the coding period. This also allowed me to better understand the requirements of my project.\nI also participated in the AGL Weekly Dev Meet events to better understand the work done at AGL and its various technical groups.\nSetting Up The Build Environment # On our first weekly GSoC meetings, Jan-Simon Möller was kind enough to set us up with the remote servers we may need to build the AGL images as building on local hardware is a time-consuming process.\nDuring my first attempt at building the AGL Flutter Instrument Cluster demo image, I encountered an issue where there wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough storage available to build new images on the server. However, this should soon be resolved after a cleanup job. So, till then I\u0026rsquo;ll continue building on my local machine.\nBuilding AGL Locally # On May 11th, I faced an AGL Build failure on Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS to which I found the solution at Yocto Docs.\nThe error was due to the oss4-dev package installed on my system, which resulted in QEMU build failures due to the package installing its custom /usr/include/linux/soundcard.h on the Debian systems.\nThis was resolved by resolving the packages.\nsudo apt-get build-dep qemu sudo apt-get remove oss4-dev Working With Kuksa-val-server, Kuksa-client and AGL Images # So in order the test my proposed implementation, I initially tried running the Docker build of the Kuksa-val server on my machine to manipulate values on the IC flutter application using my Demo application AGL-Kuksa.val-Visualiser, while it was successfully setting the required values for Vehicle.Speed, the IC application would require a hot reload every time to update the values.\nTo overcome this, I and a doubt-clearing session with Scott Murray, which led me to use the AGL Flutter Instrument Cluster demo image, by using port forwarding and establishing a connection between the host and the QEMU machine. This proved to be a failure since my host machine was able to ping the QEMU instance but not the other way around.\nThen during the weekly GSoC meeting, Marius Vlad cleared my doubts regarding this issue. He recommended I set up the communication interface using a bridge network and redirected me to the TAP network guide for testing out my implementation.\nI modified the available script for my convenience and added comments to better understand the various steps.\nSetting Up A Network Bridge # Note: script only works on the wireless interface\nTo create the bridge network br0 we run the setup_tap_wireless_int.sh script with elevated privileges. The script helps connect wireless devices to a network by creating a bridge between the wireless interface wlp4s0 and the network interface. It also sets up a DHCP and DNS server for the bridge interface and creates rules to allow traffic to flow between the wireless and network interfaces.\n#!/bin/bash # Find the wireless interface WIRELESS=$(iwconfig 2\u0026gt;/dev/null | awk \u0026#39;/IEEE 802.11/ {print $1; exit}\u0026#39;) BRIDGE=br0 NETWORK=10.10.10.0 NETMASK=255.255.255.0 GATEWAY=10.10.10.1 DHCPRANGE=10.10.10.100,10.10.10.254 # Create the bridge interface ip link add $BRIDGE type bridge ip link set dev $BRIDGE up # Assign an IP address to the bridge interface ip addr add dev $BRIDGE $GATEWAY/$NETMASK # Enable IP forwarding sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 \u0026gt; /dev/null 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 # Flush existing iptables rules and set default policies to ACCEPT iptables --flush iptables -t nat -F iptables -X iptables -Z iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT # Allow DHCP and DNS traffic on the bridge interface iptables -A INPUT -i $BRIDGE -p tcp -m tcp --dport 67 -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -i $BRIDGE -p udp -m udp --dport 67 -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -i $BRIDGE -p tcp -m tcp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -i $BRIDGE -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT # Allow forwarding of packets between the bridge and the network iptables -A FORWARD -i $BRIDGE -o $BRIDGE -j ACCEPT iptables -A FORWARD -s $NETWORK/$NETMASK -i $BRIDGE -j ACCEPT iptables -A FORWARD -d $NETWORK/$NETMASK -o $BRIDGE -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT # Accept packets from the bridge interface with source and destination within the network # to prevent masquerading of bridged frames/packets iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s $NETWORK/$NETMASK -d $NETWORK/$NETMASK -j ACCEPT # Perform network address translation (NAT) for packets from the network iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s $NETWORK/$NETMASK -j MASQUERADE # Configure dnsmasq as the DHCP and DNS server for the bridge interface dns_cmd=( dnsmasq --strict-order --except-interface=lo --interface=$BRIDGE --listen-address=$GATEWAY --bind-interfaces --dhcp-range=$DHCPRANGE --conf-file=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; --pid-file=/var/run/qemu-dnsmasq-$BRIDGE.pid --dhcp-leasefile=/var/run/qemu-dnsmasq-$BRIDGE.leases --dhcp-no-override ) # Execute the dnsmasq command echo ${dns_cmd[@]} | bash # Allow traffic from the bridge interface to the wireless interface iptables -A FORWARD -i $BRIDGE -o $WIRELESS -j ACCEPT # Perform masquerading for outgoing packets on the wireless interface iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $WIRELESS -j MASQUERADE # Allow known traffic from the wireless interface to return to the bridge interface iptables -A FORWARD -i $WIRELESS -o $BRIDGE -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT Starting The QEMU VM # For utilizing the bridge br0 created using the script, the VM needs to be started with elevated privileges, and the specified arguments.\nsudo qemu-system-x86_64 -device virtio-net-pci,\\ netdev=net0,mac=52:54:00:12:35:02 -netdev bridge \\ ,br=br0,id=net0 -drive file=agl-cluster-demo-platform-flutter-qemux86-64.ext4, \\ if=virtio,format=raw -usb -usbdevice tablet \\ -device virtio-rng-pci -snapshot -vga virtio -vnc :0 \\ -soundhw hda -machine q35 -cpu kvm64 \\ -cpu qemu64,+ssse3,+sse4.1,+sse4.2,+popcnt -enable-kvm \\ -m 2048 -serial mon:vc -serial mon:stdio -serial null -kernel bzImage \\ -append \u0026#39;root=/dev/vda rw console=tty0 mem=2048M ip=dhcp oprofile.timer=1 console=ttyS0,115200n8 verbose fstab=no\u0026#39; We enter root as the username and get access to the AGL command line.

But this is only a working solution as none of the AGL demo apps listen on this specific ip 10.10.10.204 for kuksa updates.\nWhat Next? # During the Weekly GSoC and Dev meetings of AGL, Scott Murray pointed out that soon AGL will be moving to Kuksa-databroker (written in RUST) from the currently used Kuksa-val-sever. This should not affect my implementation as Kuksa-client works with both ( using Web-sockets \u0026amp; and gRPC). This will give us the window to update our implementation and come to a working solution by the time the coding period starts.\nI will also be updating my working repository on GitHub soon, and start work on coding the GUI elements of the Application.\nAll in all, the Community bonding period proved to be extremely educational and very interactive, not just with the AGL community but also with my fellow GSoC contributors. I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to get codding and look forward to overcoming the challenges that come my way.\nResources I Found Useful # https://docs.automotivelinux.org/en/master/ https://docs.yoctoproject.org/3.2.3/index.html https://github.com/aakash-s45/ic https://gist.github.com/extremecoders-re/e8fd8a67a515fee0c873dcafc81d811c https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/tree/master/kuksa-val-server https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/tree/master/kuksa-client ","date":"26 May 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/community-bonding-period/","section":"Blog Posts","summary":"# Topics To Be Covered In This Post # What is the Community bonding period?","title":"GSoC Community Bonding Period"},{"content":" What is FOSSEE? # FOSSEE is a project developed at IIT Bombay that promotes the use of FLOSS tools in academia and research.
